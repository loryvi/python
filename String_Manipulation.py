#Here are my notes on what have I learned on Udemy on How to manipulate string in python.

#example sentence
sentence = "I lOvE wiNe and CheeSe. I lOvE tO swim Too."

print(sentence)
# prints the variable sentence

print(sentence.lower())
# lowercase all the letters. the string will now print as "i love wine and cheese. i love to swim too."

print(sentence.upper())
# uppercase all the letters

print(sentence.islower())
# checks if the letters are all in lowercase. 
# It will print "False", letters are not all in lowercase. 

print(sentence.isupper())
# checks if the letters are all in uppercase.
# prints "False", letters are not all in uppercase

print(sentence.lower().islower())
# lowercase all the letters in the sentence and checks if all letters are all in lowercase.
# prints "True" 

print(len(sentence))
# counts the letters 

print(sentence.replace("CheeSe","siSig"))
# replace the word "CheeSe" into "siSig"
# prints "I lOvE wiNe and siSig. I lOvE tO swim Too."

print(sentence.index("and"))
# counts where the sentence or letter is found.
